    <h1>Q-4 What is the second argument that can optionally be passed tosetState and what is
        its purpose?</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        In React.js, the setState function accepts two arguments: <br>

        The first argument is the new state or a function that returns the new state, which React will merge with the
        current state. <br>

        The second argument is an optional callback function that will be executed after the state has been updated and
        the component has re-rendered. This callback is often used when you need to perform an action immediately after
        the state has been updated, such as interacting with the DOM or triggering an event that depends on the updated
        state. <br>
    </p>
        <h2>Example:-</h2> <br>
        <p>
        this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 }, () => { <br>
            console.log("State updated and component re-rendered."); <br>
          });
        </p>
