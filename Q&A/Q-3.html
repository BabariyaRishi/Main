    <h1>Q-3 What is Pure Component? When to use Pure Component over Component?</h1>
    <br>
    <p>In React, a Pure Component is a type of component that implements the shouldComponentUpdate lifecycle method by
        performing a shallow comparison of the component's props and state. This means that if the props or state of the
        component do not change, the component will not re-render. The primary benefit of using PureComponent is
        performance optimization, as it can prevent unnecessary re-renders of components.</p> <br>
    
    <h2>When to Use PureComponent</h2>
    <p>
    1)Performance Optimization: <br> Use PureComponent when you want to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary
    re-renders. This is particularly useful in scenarios where the component receives frequent updates, but the props or
    state remain the same. <br><br>

    2)Shallow Comparisons: <br> Use PureComponent when your component's props and state are simple data structures
    (e.g., primitives or shallow objects). If the component's props or state include complex, deeply nested objects,
    PureComponent may not behave as expected because it only performs shallow comparisons. <br><br>

    3)Functional Components: <br> For functional components, you can achieve similar optimization using React.memo,
    which works like PureComponent by memoizing the component and skipping re-renders if props do not change. <br>
