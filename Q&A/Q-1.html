    <h1>Q-1 What is Redux?</h1>
    <br> <p>
    Redux is a state management library commonly used with JavaScript applications, especially those built with
        React. It helps manage the state of an application in a predictable way, making it easier to understand and
        debug complex applications. <br>
    <h2>=>>Benefits of Using Redux:</h2> 
    <p>
    1)Predictability: <br>Since the state is managed in a single place and can only be changed through actions, the flow
    of data becomes predictable and easier to trace. <br><br>

    2)Debugging: <br>Redux DevTools allows developers to track state changes over time, making it easier to debug
    applications. <br><br>

    3)Consistency: <br> By managing the state in a central store, Redux helps ensure that the application's state is
    consistent across different components. <br>
